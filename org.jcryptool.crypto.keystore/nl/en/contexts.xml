      <description>The &lt;b&gt;Keystore&lt;/b&gt; view stores all JCrypTool cryptographic keys in a single place. This includes public and private key pairs (asymmetric), secret keys (symmetric) as well as certificates. All these keys can be used by any JCrypTool-Crypto-Plug-in. 

For convenience, JCrypTool is shipped with some default keys. The default password for these keys is &lt;b&gt;1234&lt;/b&gt;.

Use the toolbar or the menu to create new keys, delete existing or to im- and export keys.
