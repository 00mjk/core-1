	<h1>Accessing the keystore</h1>
	
	<p>The JCrypTool Keystore is managed by the KeyStoreManager (org.jcryptool.crypto.keystore.backend.KeyStoreManager) in the <b>org.jcryptool.crypto.keystore</b> plug-in. It is recommended that all
	crypto plug-ins use this keystore to store and retrieve their own keys. Keystore management takes place in the <b>Algorithm</b> perspective in the <b>Keystore</b> view.</p>
	
	<p>The KeyStoreManager is implemented as singleton, the instance can be retrieved via <b>KeyStoreManager ksm = KeyStoreManager.getInstance();</b>. This instance enables developers to add, update,
	delete or retrieve keys (public, private, secret) and certificates.</p>
	
	<p>The JCrypTool keystore is initialized once during the first JCrypTool start and will be stored in the workspace directory. This process creates some sample keys as well. All these sample keys are
	protected with the password <b>1234</b>. It is recommended that all crypto plug-ins use the same password for their own keys.</p>
