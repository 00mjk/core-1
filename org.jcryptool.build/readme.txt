There are several ways to build JCrypTool binary releases. This is the org.jcryptool.build
project for an automated build of JCrypTool. Have a look at the wiki page

https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jcryptool/index.php?title=BuildAutomatic

for a description on how to use this build.

In case you only want to create a binary release for test purposes it is easier to use the
export wizard in the jcryptool.product (org.jcryptool.core project).
