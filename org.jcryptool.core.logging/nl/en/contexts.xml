   		<description>This page allows you to choose the JCrypTool logging level. The default log level is <b>Error</b>, which only logs critical errors. <b>Warning</b> includes problems and uncritical errors. And finally <b>Info</b> simply logs everything, from errors up to the debug information which is mainly used during plug-in development. Since the last two levels do log a lot of messages, JCrypTool will slow down. So the best thing to do is to use the default level <b>Error</b> and to only switch to another log level if additional information is required (e.g. to find an error inside a plug-in).</description>
