      <description>The &lt;b&gt;Crypto Explorer&lt;/b&gt; view lists all available cryptographic operations in JCrypTool ordered by category. A file must be opened in one of the JCrypTool editors in order to execute an &lt;b&gt;Algorithm&lt;/b&gt;. This is the case for views in the category &lt;b&gt;Analysis&lt;/b&gt; too. &lt;b&gt;Visualizations&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Games&lt;/b&gt; generally do not require an opened file.

Use the menu to switch between the tree and palette presentation. The filter field enables you to filter for the name of an algorithm, analysis, visualization or game.</description>
