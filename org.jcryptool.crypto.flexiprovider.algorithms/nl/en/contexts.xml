      <description>The &lt;b&gt;Algorithms&lt;/b&gt; view is the heart of the FlexiProvider perspective. It shows all the algorithms implemented in FlexiProvider, grouped by their functionality (like block cipher, signature schemes etc.).

An algorithm can be selected via a double click on its name. In the appearing wizard the user can change the parameters of the algorithm, like the block cipher mode.

Selecting a function (algorithm) is the first step. All following steps are then shown in the Operations view window.</description>
