	<h1>JCrypTool Help</h1>

	<p>Welcome to the JCrypTool online help! The help system for the JCrypTool e-learning platform
	consists of two categories:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>The <strong>User Guide</strong> describes the functions JCrypTool offers:
	    From the various editors and the visualisations up to the plug-ins for encrypting, signing, etc. <br>This is the best entry point if you have never used JCrypTool before.</li>
	    <li>The <strong>Developer Guide</strong> contains information for interested developers and
	    advanced users who wish to extend JCrypTool with their own plug-ins.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As with the rest of JCrypTool the online help is modularly extensible. Every crypto plug-in is responsible for delivering its own help content to the <b>User Guide</b>. So if you can't find any help for a certain plug-in the developer most likely didn't write one yet.</p>

	<p>More information about JCrypTool is available on our <a href="http://www.cryptool.org/">home page</a>.
	The source code for both, <a href="https://github.com/jcryptool/core">JCrypTool Core</a> and 
	<a href="https://github.com/jcryptool/crypto">JCrypTool Crypto</a>, is available freely for download.</p>
