	<h1>JCrypTool Help</h1>

	<p>Welcome to the JCrypTool online help! The extensive help system for the JCrypTool e-learning platform
	consists of four categories:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>The <strong>User Guide</strong> describes all the possibilities you have with JCrypTool,
	    from the various editors up to the plug-ins for encrypting, signing and many more. This is the
	    best entry point if you have never used JCrypTool before...</li>
	    <li>The <strong>Developer Guide</strong> contains information for interested developers and
	    advanced users who wish to extend JCrypTool with their own plug-ins...</li>
	    <li><strong>Cryptology</strong> contains the cryptographic basics for all in JCrypTool included
	    algorithms, information about digital signatures, encryption and much more...</li>
	    <li>The <strong>Glossary</strong> finally explains in short the meaning of several cryptographic terms...</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As with the rest of JCrypTool the online help is extremely extensible. And as with the plug-ins itself,
	every crypto plug-in is responsible for contributing its own help content. So if you can't find any help
	for a certain plug-in the developer most likely didn't write one yet. Additionally it may be possible
	that the help content is not available in both JCrypTool languages German and English.</p>

	<p>More information and support for JCrypTool is available on our <a href="http://www.cryptool.org/">home page</a>.
	Both, the <a href="https://github.com/jcryptool/core">JCrypTool Core source code</a> and the
	<a href="https://github.com/jcryptool/crypto">JCrypTool Crypto source code</a>, are available for download too.</p>
