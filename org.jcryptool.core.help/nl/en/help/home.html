	<h1>JCrypTool Help</h1>

	<p>Welcome to the JCrypTool online help! The extensive help system for the JCrypTool e-learning platform
	consists of three categories:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>The <strong>User Guide</strong> describes all functions JCrypTool offers;
	    from the various editors up to the plug-ins for encrypting, signing and many more. This is an
	    optimal entry point if you have never used JCrypTool before.</li>
	    <li>The <strong>Developer Guide</strong> contains information for interested developers and
	    advanced users who wish to extend JCrypTool with their own plug-ins.</li>
	    <li><strong>Cryptology</strong> contains information regarding the theory of cryptography, 
	    algorithms, digital signatures, encryption, and more.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As with the rest of JCrypTool the online help is extremely extensible. And as with the plug-ins itself,
	every crypto plug-in is responsible for contributing its own help content to the User Guide. So if you can't find any help
	for a certain plug-in the developer most likely didn't write one yet.</p>

	<p>More information about JCrypTool is available on our <a href="http://www.cryptool.org/">home page</a>.
	The source code for both <a href="https://github.com/jcryptool/core">JCrypTool Core</a> and 
	<a href="https://github.com/jcryptool/crypto">JCrypTool Crypto</a> is available for download as well.</p>
