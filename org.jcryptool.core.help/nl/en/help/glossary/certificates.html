<h1>Digital Certificate</h1>

<p>In cryptography, a digital certificate (or identity certificate) is a certificate which uses a digital signature to bind together a public key with an identity Â— information such as the name of a person or an organization, their address, and so forth. The certificate can be used to verify that a public key belongs to an individual, which is used to achieve data confidentiality, authenticity and message integrity.</p>
