	<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>

	<h2>Using JCrypTool in a network environment or on a USB stick</h2>

	<p>In principle it is possible to use JCrypTool in a network environment or on an external storage medium like a USB stick or a USB hard disk. To
	enable this you have to do a minor change in one of the configuration files. It is necessary to change the path to the default workspace folder.
	This folder is used by all plug-ins to store your specific preferences.</p>

	<p><strong>Windows/ Linux:</strong> Open the file <strong>JCrypTool.ini</strong> in your installation folder and search for the line
	<strong>-data @user.home/.jcryptool</strong>. Replace <strong>@user.home/.jcryptool</strong> with the absolute path to a folder available in
	your environment.</p>

	<p><strong>Mac OS X:</strong> The required changes are identical with the ones described above for Windows/ Linux. However the file
	<strong>JCrypTool.ini</strong> is located at <strong>JCrypTool.app\Contents\MacOS</strong> in your installation folder.</p>

	<h2>Switching the JCrypTool language</h2>

	<p>The initial JCrypTool language is based on your operating systems regional settings. An English Windows normally launches an English JCrypTool.
	However it is still possible that some plug-ins are shown only in German. The reason for that is simple: the plug-in is not available in English.</p>

	<p>In order to change the JCrypTool language, open the <a href="../general/preferences.html">Preferences</a> and switch to the
	<strong>General</strong> page. Simply select the desired language. JCrypTool must be restarted in order for the changes to take effect.</p>

	<h2>Updating JCrypTool</h2>

	<p>JCrypTool contains an integrated <a href="../general/updates.html">update mechanism</a>. Use the <strong>Help</strong> menu for all update
	operations. This menu contains the entries <strong>Check for Updates</strong> and <strong>Install new Software</strong>. However JCrypTool does
	not automatically search for new updates. You can either call the update search manually via the menu entry or you can change the
	<a href="../general/preferences.html">Preferences</a> on the <strong>Automatic Updates</strong> page to search automatically.</p>

	<h2>Updates are not visible</h2>

	<p>It is possible that even after a successful installation the updates/ changes are not visible. This may occur for newly installed plug-ins as well
	as updates for existing ones. The reason for that is the JCrypTool workspace folder, which caches and stores all plug-in information. Sometimes this
	information is not updated and the data stored there does not reflect the current installation any more.</p>

	<p>To solve this you can either delete the <strong>.jcryptool</strong> folder in your document directory (inside your user home directory) manually or you
	can tell JCrypTool to do that job. Remember when trying to delete this folder that it is hidden on Mac OS X and Linux. To let JCrypTool delete this folder
	simply add the parameter <strong>-clean</strong> add the end when launching JCrypTool (e.g. add it to the shortcut on Windows). This automatically deletes the
	workspace folder. This folder is automatically recreated and initialized when starting JCrypTool the next time. Remember to remove the parameter afterwards.</p>
