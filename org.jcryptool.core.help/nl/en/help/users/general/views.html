	<h1>Views</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool offers a lot of different views. Most of them do display a certain cryptographic operation, like analysis or visualizations.
	These view open in half screen size or even full screen automatically. Other views, like the <strong>Error Log</strong> view for example,
	serve a special purpose only (in this case to display error and information messages depending on the selected log level in the
	<a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a>).</p>

	<p>You can close, resize and move any view. In case you closed a view accidentally you can reopen it using the menu
	<strong>Window -&gt; Show View</strong>. A double click on the views tab maximizes it to full screen. Another double click on the tab
	minimizes the view again to its original size.</p>

	<p>An overview of all views is available in the menu <strong>Window -&gt; Show View -&gt; Other</strong>. The appearing dialog contains
	all available views, sorted by category. Already visible views in this <a href="perspectives.html">Perspective</a> are shown inactive.</p>

    <div class="screenshot">

    </div>

	<p>The most important views for cryptographic operations in JCrypTool are the
	<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.fileexplorer/$nl$/help/view.html">File Explorer</a> view and the <a href="view_algorithms.html">Crypto Explorer</a>
	view. For experts and those in a hurry there are the
    <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.commands.ui/$nl$/help/view.html">Console</a>
    and the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.actions.ui/$nl$/help/view.html">Actions</a> view.</p>

    <h2>Fast Views</h2>

    <p>The status bar in the lower left of JCrypTool contains an icon, which lets you open a so called <strong>fast view</strong>. Fast views are normal
    views, but are automatically hidden when loosing focus. Each fast view shows an additional icon next to the default fast view icon.</p>

    <div class="screenshot">
    	<img src="images/fast_views.png" width="340" height="200" alt="Fast Views"/>
    </div>

    <p> Every view can be used as a fast view. A view can either be used as fast view or as normal view, not both at the same time. So in case you are
    showing the File Explorer as a fast view, the normal view is changed to a fast view. To change a fast view to a normal view again right click on the
    views fast view icon and deactivate the <strong>Fast View</strong> entry.</p>
