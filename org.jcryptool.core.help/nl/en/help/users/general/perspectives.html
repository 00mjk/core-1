	<h1>Perspectives</h1>

	<p>Perspectives can be regarded as containers, in which other components, namely <a href="views.html">views</a> and
	<a href="editors.html">editors</a>, are embedded and can be layouted in almost any way you desire.</p>

	<p>JCrypTool offers two perspectives: <a href="perspective_default.html">Default</a> and
  	<a href="perspective_algorithm.html">Algorithm</a>. The <strong>Default perspective</strong> shows all possibilities
  	in a common way with menus and views to the beginner. The <strong>Algorithm perspective</strong> is more suitable for
  	advanced users and enables you to define every cryptographic operation in every possible detail.</p>

	<p>Initially, JCrypTool has already defined the layout of both perspectives. In case of miss configuration or other problems
	you can use the menu <strong>Window -> Reset Perspective</strong> to go back to the initial configuration of that
	perspective.</p>

	<p>After launching JCrypTool, always the last active perspective is shown. Use the buttons in the upper right of the main window,
	or the menu <strong>Window -> Open Perspective</strong>, to switch between the existing perspectives. The menu
	<strong>Window -> Customize Perspective</strong> opens a dialog in which you can select the elements (menu entries and
	toolbar icons) that should be displayed in the current perspective.</p>

    <p>Views are independent in each perspective. Closing or moving a view in the Default perspective has absolutely no effect on
    the same view in the Algorithm perspective. Editors on the other side are shared between perspectives. Closing an editor
    in the Default perspective does close this editor in the Algorithm perspective as well.</p>
