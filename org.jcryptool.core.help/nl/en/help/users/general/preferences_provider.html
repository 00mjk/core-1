    <p>When selecting a certain algorithm in one of the crypto plug-ins, JCrypTool tries to find an implementation for it. All installed crypto
    provider are searched in the defined order, as long as a crypto provider provides support for this algorithm. So in case more than one provider
    offers support for a certain algorithm you can select the one to use by changing the crypto provider order. In case none of the installed providers
    offers support for an algorithm an error is shown.</p>

    <p>The default crypto provider in JCrypTool is <strong>FlexiProvider</strong>. Additionally <strong>BouncyCastle</strong> is included in every
    installation.</p>
