	<h1>Default Perspective</h1>

	<p>The <strong>Default Perspective</strong> is the document- or file-oriented main perspective. This perspective allows
	easy access to all JCrypTool functionality. The
	<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.fileexplorer/$nl$/help/view.html">File Explorer</a> view on the left side provides
	easy access to the file system. As an alternative the default actions to open (save/ create) files are available in the
	applications <strong>File</strong> menu and the toolbar. Use the <a href="view_algorithms.html">Crypto Explorer</a> view on the
	right side for easy access on all available (installed) cryptographic operations. The cryptography menus in the menu bar do
	contain the same entries as the Algorithm view.</p>

    <p>This clearly shows the file oriented concept used all over JCrypTool: Open a file first and execute the selected
    cryptographic operation on this file. The original file always remains untouched; every operation generates a new,
    temporary, file. This concept normally requires that you open a file first before you can execute a cryptographic
    operation.</p>

    <p>However not all cryptographic operations do require an opened file in one of the <a href="editors.html">editors</a>:
    <a href="../visualizations/toc.html">Visualizations</a> and <a href="../games/toc.html">Games</a> for example are opened
    in full-screen view, without any reference to an editor.</p>
