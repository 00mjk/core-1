    <h1>Preferences</h1>

    <p>You can open the preferences via <strong>Window -> Preferences</strong>. The settings are separated in categories. A lot of those categories
    do reflect the usual JCrypTool categories (like Algorithms, Visualizations). Please be aware that preferences for a plug-in are optional, no
    crypto plug-in is forced to offer preferences. Instead it is possible sometimes to define personal settings directly in the wizard or the view
    of the corresponding crypto plug-in.</p>

    <p>The fastest way to find the preference page for a certain plug-in is using the search field in the preferences dialog. Simply enter the search string
    (like the algorithm or view name) and select the correct page in the result. The category of a preference page is normally determined by the plug-ins
    category. A crypto game therefore is available in the <strong>Games</strong> category, just like in the main application window. Other crypto categories
    are the well-known <strong>Algorithms</strong>, <strong>Analysis</strong> and <strong>Visualizations</strong>.</p>

	  <p>Besides the crypto plug-ins settings, the preferences do contain a lot of general settings for the whole JCrypTool application. E.g. it is possible to
	  select the language for JCrypTool. The initial language is automatically chosen and based on your operating system. However you can select to run JCrypTool
	  in a different language. Changing the language requires to restart JCrypTool.</p>

	  <h2>Logging</h2>

	  <p>The <strong>Logging</strong> page enables you to select the active protocol level. Default is <strong>Error</strong>, which means that only critical errors
	  are written to the JCrypTool log file. <strong>Warn</strong> additionally logs uncritical errors, <strong>Info</strong> simply logs everything. The info level
	  is normally only interesting for developers who want to test their own plug-in and therefore need as much information as possible. We recommend to only change
	  the log level if you have a good reason to do so (e.g. to get more information for an error). Switch back to the default level as soon as possible. The info log
	  level not only creates a lot of log entries, but slows down JCrypTool too.</p>

	  <p>The generated log file is easily accessible via the <strong>Error Log</strong> view. Select <strong>Window -> Show View</strong> and choose the view in the
	  <strong>General</strong> category.</p>

		<h2>Editors</h2>

		<p>The category Editors does contain the settings for the editors available in JCrypTool.</p>

		<h2>Cryptography</h2>

		<p>This category contains general settings of different crypto plug-ins. The settings here are normally not only used by one plug-ins but plug-in families.
		<strong>Alphabets</strong> for example lets you define and manage alphabets for all classic algorithms. <strong>Crypto Provider</strong> enables you to install
		and define crypto providers used all over JCrypTool.</p>
