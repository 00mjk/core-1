	<h1>General Information</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool is based on Eclipse, which brings in important concepts like <a href="perspectives.html">perspectives</a>,
	<a href="views.html">views</a> and <a href="editors.html">editors</a>. You can learn all you need to know about these
	concepts when using JCrypTool on the following pages.</p>

	<p>A view with context sensitive help is available on the lower left in both perspectives to make JCrypTool usage as
	easy as possible. The help contents shown here are based on the active (currently selected) GUI part. Use the links to
	open the complete online help with more information on the topic. Please remember that the context help must be provided by
	each plug-in. In case this information is missing the plug-in author simply did not provide any content.</p>

    <div class="screenshot">
    	<img src="images/context_help.png" width="257" height="384" alt="Context Help"/>
    </div>

	<p>A lot of wizards and dialogs provide the same context help. This information can be accessed via the help icon (presented
	by an <strong>?</strong>) in the lower left corner. Again, this information must be provided by the plug-in itself.</p>
