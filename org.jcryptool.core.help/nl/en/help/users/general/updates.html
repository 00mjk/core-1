    <h1>Updates</h1>

    <p>JCrypTool comes with an integrated <strong>Update Manager</strong>. This enables you to search for updates of installed plug-ins,
    and to install new plug-ins and features directly in JCrypTool. There is no need that new plug-ins must be available on the default
  	JCrypTool update site. Instead you can add your own update sites by entering their URL.</p>

  	<p>All update functionality is accessible via the Help menu: <strong>Check for Updates</strong> and <strong>Install New Software...</strong>.
  	The preferences allow you to set different options around the update functionality on three pages. Be aware that an active Internet
  	connection is required for all update operations and that you may have to enter a Proxy for your Internet connection.</p>

  	<p>By default, JCrypTool automatically scans for new updates during every startup. If new versions are available, a popup notification will
  	tell you about it:</p>

    <div class="screenshot">
       <img src="images/updates_available.png" width="236" height="108" alt="New updates available"/>
    </div>

    <p>Simply click on the notification and follow the instructions in the update wizard.</p>

  	<h2>Check for Updates</h2>

  	<p>This menu entry starts the update search for all installed plug-ins. In case updates are discovered you have to select which ones
  	you want to install. After that you have to (read and) accept the license conditions. In case the plug-in is not signed with a known
  	digital signature you have to agree that you want to install the plug-in anyway.</p>

  	<p>After the installation is completed JCrypTool will ask you to restart the application or to apply the changes. Normally the better
  	choice is to restart JCrypTool. This makes sure that the newly installed updates can be enabled correctly.</p>

  	<p>In order to enable update search for a plug-in, the plug-in's configuration must contain a valid update site. This site is managed
  	by the plug-in developer. For JCrypTool plug-ins (core and crypto plug-ins) a common update site is available. The URL of that page is
  	<strong>https://www.cryptool.org/jct/update</strong>. You never need to enter this URL in a browser or somewhere else inside JCrypTool;
  	it is already configured for all plug-ins. JCrypTool contacts this site while searching for updates. Other plug-ins may configure their
  	update sites, which will be contacted as well during update search.</p>

  	<h2>Install new Software</h2>

  	<p>Besides the update installation the JCrypTool update manager enables you to install new plug-ins or complete features as well. Update
  	sites are used for this functionality as well. To enable the installation of new plug-ins, you can enter new update site URLs via the update
  	dialog.</p>

  	<p>Afterwards simply choose an update site and search this site. Already installed plug-ins are deactivated and cannot
  	be selected again. Remember that update sites are grouped. Groups are for example classic plug-ins. However not every update site does use
  	this grouping feature. In case no plug-ins are shown for installation try to deactivate the grouping functionality (the checkbox). The update
  	site won't be as organized any more, but all entries will be visible in the dialog.</p>

  	<p>Simply choose the plug-ins you intend to install. Accept the license conditions and confirm the installation of unsigned plug-ins if
  	necessary. We recommend restarting JCrypTool after the installation to make sure all new plug-ins are properly activated.</p>

  	<h2>Possible Problems</h2>

  	<p>Sometimes the update installation or the new installation of a plug-in fails. This already can happen in the update manager and a plug-in
  	which cannot be selected for installation. Even after successfully downloading a plug-in the installation may fail. The reason for that are
  	most of the time missing requirements (the plug-in requires some other plug-ins to work properly). In case those plug-ins are not available
  	on your system and are not contained in the new plug-in, it cannot work. The best thing to do is to contact the plug-in developer and to
  	ask for help.</p>
