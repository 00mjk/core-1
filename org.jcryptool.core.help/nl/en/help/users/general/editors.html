	<h1>Editors</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool contains two different editors in the default installation: <a href="editor_text.html">Text</a> and <a href="editor_hex.html">Hex</a>.
	While the text editor is capable of handling normal text files only, (almost) any file can be opened in the hex editor.</p>

	<p>The result of a cryptographic operation is normally opened in an editor of the same type (text in the text editor and hex in the hex editor). Depending
	on the cryptographic operation it might be necessary to open the resulting file in the hex editor (in order to avoid display errors).</p>

	<p>After opening a file in one of the editors it is possible to switch to the other editor using the <strong>Edit -> Open with</strong> menu.</p>
