	<h1>Changing the language</h1>

	<p>The initial JCrypTool language is based on your operating systems regional settings. An English Windows normally launches an English JCrypTool.
	However it is still possible that some plug-ins are shown only in German. The reason for that is simple: the plug-in is not available in English.</p>

	<p>In order to change the JCrypTool language, open the <a href="../general/preferences.html">Preferences</a> and switch to the
	<strong>General</strong> page. Simply select the desired language. JCrypTool must be restarted in order for the changes to take effect.</p>

	</div>

	<p>It is possible that after a restart JCrypTool menus contain a mix of English and German entries. This might be because of plug-ins that are only available
	in German, but normally indicates a problem with the JCrypTool cache. Please quit JCrypTool and switch to the <strong>@user.home/documents/.jcryptool</strong>
	directory in your file manager. Delete the complete <strong>.metadata</strong> directory in this directory. This resets all plug-in settings but keeps your
	crypto keys created in JCrypTool. You can delete the complete <strong>.jcryptool</strong> directory alternatively, but you will lose all your settings and
	data this way.</p>
