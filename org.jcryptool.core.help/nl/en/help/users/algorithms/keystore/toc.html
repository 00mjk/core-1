	<h1>Keystore</h1>

<p>The JCrypTool keystore contains all predefined and self-generated keys for cryptographic operations.
It contains among others RSA, ElGamal, AES and ECDH keys. The predefined keys allow a quick start in JCrypTool.
They all have the same <b>password 1234</b>.</p>

	<p>The key store is required in the standard and algorithm perspective. It provides keys for certain cryptographic operations.</p>

	<p>In the standard perspective the keystore can be opened via the <b>Algorithms -> Keystore</b> menu. In the
Algorithm Perspective, it is open by default. If it is not open, it can be opened via the menu <b>Window -> Show View -> 
Keystore</b> can be opened.</p>

	<p>The key store allows you to create, view, delete, import and export keys. Many of these actions are available with a right click on a key.</p>
