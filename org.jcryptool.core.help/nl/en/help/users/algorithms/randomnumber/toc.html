	<h2>xxxAbout MACs</h2>

	<p>xxxIn cryptography, a message authentication code (MAC) is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message—in other words, to confirm that the message came from the stated sender (its authenticity) and has not been changed (its integrity). Verifiers (who also possess the secret key) can detect any changes to the message content.</p>

	<p>xxxWhile MAC functions are similar to cryptographic hash functions, they possess different security requirements and the so called signing function doesn't use only the message but also a symmetric key as input. MACs also differ from digital signatures as MAC values are both generated and verified using the same shared secret key, while digital signatures use the private key of the sender for signing and the public key of the sender for verification.</p>

	<h2>xxxAbout MICs and message digests</h2>

	<p>xxThis is just a remark about similar terms sometimes are mistaken.</p>

	<p>xxxThe term message integrity code (MIC) is frequently substituted for the term MAC, especially in communications, in order to distinguish it from the use of MAC meaning MAC address (for media access control address). So MAC and MIC are used interchangeably.</p>

	<p>xxxHowever, sometimes MIC is used to refer to a message digest, which is different from a MAC because a message digest does not use a secret key.</p>
