	<h1>User Guide</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool is based on the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> Rich Client Platform (RCP). You will recognize a lot of concepts
	in case you ever worked with Eclipse or an Eclipse RCP.</p>

	<p>Beginner or not, the <strong>User Guide</strong> will introduce you in the many possibilities you do have with JCrypTool. The following pages
	therefore contain information about the different <a href="general/editors.html">Editors</a>, <a href="general/views.html">Views</a> and
    <a href="general/perspectives.html">Perspectives.</a> And of course the crypto plug-ins, starting from <a href="algorithms/toc.html">Algorithms</a>,
    <a href="analysis/toc.html">Cryptanalysis</a>, <a href="games/toc.html">Games</a> and last but not least <a href="visualizations/toc.html">Visualizations</a>.</p>

    <p>Please keep in mind that the <strong>User Guide</strong> contents have to be delivered by the crypto plug-ins. Generally this means that one plug-in
    contains more help, the other plug-in less. Sometimes only one language is available, and not both English and German. In case you do have any question about
    a certain plug-in or need more assistance it is best to contact the plug-in developer directly. In case you do not know the developer or you cannot reach him
    feel free to post a message in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jcryptool-users">JCrypTool Users Group</a>.</p>

    <p>The online help for the JCrypTool core is fully available in German and English.</p>

    <p>Your feedback (bugs, ideas, and wishes) is very welcome, no matter whether it's for a core or a crypto plug-in. Feel free to post to the
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jcryptool-users">JCrypTool Users Group</a>.</p>
