	<h1>General Information</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool is based on Eclipse (Luna Release - version 4.4) and Java 1.7 and can be extended by anyone with custom plug-ins
	and features. These extensions can be inserted at every place within the whole e-learning platform.</p>

	<p>To ensure a simple handling and to present a consistent appearance the JCrypTool core developers published guidelines for
	 all plug-in developers. These guidelines of JCrypTool core consist of rules on how to extend the
	 <a href="../develop/plugins/help.html">Help Content</a>, <a href="../develop/plugins/preferences.html">Preference Pages</a>,
	 <a href="../develop/extensionpoints.html">Extension Points</a> and some more. Plug-ins which do violate these guidelines won't
	 be included in our official release and won't be listed on our official <strong>JCrypTool Update Site</strong>.</p>

	 <p>Besides some <a href="conventions.html">Conventions</a> are all development guidelines included in the
	 <a href="../develop/toc.html">Development</a> area. In addition to these guidelines all developers are supposed to follow the
	 <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html">Code Conventions for Java</a> and the
	 <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Development_Conventions_and_Guidelines">Eclipse Development Conventions and Guidelines</a>.</p>
