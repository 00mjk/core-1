	<h1>Target Platform</h1>

	<p>A target platform decouples the target platform from the development platform. On one side this requires some
	additional setup work but on the other side makes later development much easier.</p>

	<p>There are two possibilities to create a target platform: The <a href="#automaticSetup">automatic setup</a>
	(recommended) and the <a href="#manualSetup">manual setup</a>.</p>

	<a name="automaticSetup"></a><h2>Automatic Setup</h2>

	<p><strong>Be aware that an active Internet connection is required and you will be downloading some megabytes
	into your workspace.</strong></p>

	<p>In order to use the target definition file, you'll have to check out our sources first. The JCrypTool target
	definition is contained in the file <strong>jcryptool.target</strong> in the <strong>org.jcryptool.releng</strong>
	project. Simply open this file in the <strong>Target Editor</strong>. Eclipse will now try to resolve all
	plug-ins referenced in this file, which will take quite a while depending on your hardware and your Internet
	connection speed. After resolving all plug-ins, the target definition editor will show something like the
	following screenshot:</p>

    <div class="screenshot">
    	<img src="images/target-definition.png" width="720" height="718" alt="Target Definition"/>
    </div>

	<p>The next thing to do is to click on the <strong>Set as Target Platform</strong> link in the upper right which
	will download and install all configured plug-ins as your active target platform. This includes the optional
	German translations from Eclipse Babel, so you can launch an English and a German JCrypTool right away. The
	setup process is finished after all JCrypTool projects have been automatically re-builded.</p>

	<a name="manualSetup"></a><h2>Manual Setup</h2>

	<p>The contained plug-ins in the <strong>Eclipse RCP SDK</strong> form the basis of the JCrypTool RCP, but do not
	contain all required plug-ins. This forces you to copy additional plug-ins manually from the <em>normal</em>
	Eclipse IDE into target platform directory.</p>

	<h3>Proceeding</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>Download the Eclipse RCP SDK
		(<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads</a>)
		(e.g. <strong>org.eclipse.rcp.source-3.6.1.zip</strong>) and extract it into an	empty directory.</li>
		<li>Launch your normal Eclipse IDE installation, the Eclipse RCP SDK extracted before is <strong>not</strong>
		executable.</li>
		<li>Setup this directory in the JCrypTool workspace preferences as new target definition (switch to the
		<strong>Target Platform</strong> page, click the <strong>Add</strong> button for a new target platform and
		select the previously created directory as <strong>Location</strong>).</li>
		<li>After closing the preferences select the <strong>org.jcryptool.core.dependencies.feature</strong> project
		and open the <strong>feature.xml</strong> file. Switch to the Plug-ins tab and identify the missing plug-ins
		with the help of the yellow exclamation marks. Copy those jar files from the Eclipse IDE directory to your
		target platform. Remember to refresh your target definition in the preferences after adding new plug-ins. Repeat
		this step until all warnings are gone. Be careful: The dependencies feature does reference plug-ins and three included
		features. So open the included feature definitions as well (double click on each entry) and make sure the feature as well
		as all referenced plug-ins are contained in the target platform! You can only ignore the org.eclipse.rcp feature since
		this feature and all its plug-ins are provided by the RCP SDK installed before.</li>
		<li>Only plug-ins in the <strong>org.jcryptool.core.dependencies.nl_de.feature</strong> feature are optional, all
		other plug-ins are required.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>This created a fully functional target platform, but only for your active operating system. This is good enough for
	JCrypTool. But in order to support other operating systems you need to execute the following steps as well:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Download the Eclipse Delta Pack
		(<a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads</a>)
		(<strong>eclipse-3.6.1-delta-pack.zip</strong> for any platform) and extract it into the target directory created
		above. Overwrite all files if prompted.</li>
		<li>Refresh the target platform in the preferences.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>This enables you to export JCrypTool for any supported platform. In order to get a completely German GUI you need to
	execute the following steps as well:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Load Eclipse Babel (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/babel/">http://www.eclipse.org/babel</a>) and download the following files
		for Eclipse Helios:
			<ol>
				<li>BabelLanguagePack-eclipse-de_3.6.0.v20100814043401.zip</li>
				<li>BabelLanguagePack-rt.equinox.p2-de_3.6.0.v20100814043401.zip</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>You can extract those files into the target platform created above. However we do recommend creating a different directory outside
		the rest of the target platform. Extract the two zip archives in there.</li>
		<li>Add a new <strong>Location</strong> in the target definition created above and select the directory containing the <strong>Language Packs</strong>.</li>
		<li>After the automatic rebuild the <strong>feature.xml</strong> in the <strong>org.jcryptool.core.dependencies.nl_de.feature</strong>
		project should not show any more warnings.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>That is all you have to do for target platform setup. Every once in a while a new plug-in dependency is added to JCrypTool in the
	dependencies feature. In case the <strong>feature.xml</strong> displays a warning you have to update your target platform with one or
	more new plug-ins as described above.</p>

	<p>We always develop against the latest <strong>stable</strong> Eclipse version. This requires to update the target platform after
	a new Eclipse release (e.g. Eclipse 3.6.2) is available as well. We recommend to start with a fresh target platform in this case
	and not to update the existing one.</p>
