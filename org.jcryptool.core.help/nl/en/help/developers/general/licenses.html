	<h1>Licenses</h1>

	<p>There are many open source licenses available, under which you can publish your JCrypTool plug-in. However, all our plug-ins are published
	under the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">Eclipse Public License (EPL) Version 1.0</a>. Again, you are absolutely free
	to choose another license. In case you intend to integrate your plug-in in one of our GitHub projects, you'll have to use the EPL.</p>

	<h2>Conditions</h2>

	<p>In order to use the EPL correctly, you have to integrate an EPL hint in all your Java classes. We are using the following disclaimer
	(feel free to use that too):</p>
