	<h1>Eclipse Plug-ins</h1>

	<p>The default installation of JCrypTool already includes a lot of Eclipse plug-ins (the installation of those plug-ins
	is guaranteed by JCrypTool). These plug-ins can be used by plug-in developers as in any other Eclipse installation. Normally the
	latest available plug-in version is included in JCrypTool. Only not included plug-ins or special required plug-in versions
	(try to avoid that) have to be shipped by the plug-in developer.</p>

	<p>So the moment you start putting together a <a href="../develop/features/toc.html">feature</a> for JCrypTool you should check out
	which Eclipse plug-ins are already contained in the <strong>plugins</strong> directory of JCrypTool. There is no need for you to ship
	those plug-ins again with your feature. It is possible though without any negative consequences but your feature size grows without
	any benefit. You only have to include plug-ins that are not contained in the JCrypTool default installation, otherwise your plug-in
	won't work.</p>

	<p>You will find a complete overview of all in a JCrypTool version contained Eclipse plug-ins in the
	<strong>org.jcryptool.core.dependencies.feature</strong> project. Have a look at the <strong>Plug-ins</strong> and <strong>Included Features</strong>
	tab for a complete list. Check out the <strong>org.jcryptool.core.dependencies.nl_de.feature</strong> project for a complete list
	of all German language packs.</p>
