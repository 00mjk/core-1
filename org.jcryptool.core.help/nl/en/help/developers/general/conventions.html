	<h1>Conventions</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool consists of many different plug-ins, developed by many different people. This inevitably results into
	many differences in plug-in development. To minimize those differences we do give some conventions and recommendations,
	which all developers should keep in mind.</p>

	<p>At the same time, we provide the <strong>org.jcryptool.core.util</strong> plug-in which represents a utility plug-in,
	to make JCrypTool development easier and faster. Feel free to use the functionality provided here in your plug-in.</p>

    <h2>Reusing Code</h2>

    <p>Every extension point offered by a plug-in can be used (consumed) in your own code. But even outside of extension points, JCrypTool
    offers various methods and services that should make your development easier and faster. You should especially have a look at the
    <strong>org.jcryptool.core.util</strong> plug-in. Besides the described services in the next table, this plug-in offers the
    interface <strong>IConstants</strong>, which provides different global constants usable all over JCrypTool. Apart from making the
    development easier, these methods and services take care of a more unique look &amp; feel of JCrypTool.</p>

	<h2>Categories</h2>

	<p>Normally interested developers do contribute crypto plug-ins. The official JCrypTool Plug-ins in this category
	always start with <strong>org.jcryptool</strong>. The following table shows the complete names of all
	existing categories today.</p>

	<table style="width: 98%">
	  <thead>
	    <tr>
	      <th style="width:50%">Type</th>
	      <th style="width:50%">Description</th>
	    </tr>

	      <td>org.jcryptool.visual</td>
	    </tr>
	  </tbody>
	</table>

	<p>The categories name reflects in the so called branding plug-in. This plug-in takes care of the branding of all plug-ins in this
	category and can contain general code used by one or more plug-ins. The feature of a category can be identified by adding
	<strong>.feature</strong> to the name of the branding plug-in.</p>

	<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>

	<p>With regard to the category plug-ins should end with the name of the implementing algorithm or cryptographic procedure,
	e.g. <strong>org.jcryptool.crypto.classic.xor</strong> or <strong>org.jcryptool.visual.ecdh</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Implementation</h2>

	<p><strong>System.out.println()</strong> (or its counterpart <strong>System.err.println</strong>) as well as
	<strong>printStackTrace()</strong> calls are not allowed inside plug-ins. Neither are <strong>public static void main</strong>
	methods or <strong>System.exit()</strong> calls.</p>

	<h2>Other Conventions</h2>

	<p>Stick to the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html">Code Conventions for Java</a>
	and the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Development_Conventions_and_Guidelines">Eclipse Development Conventions and Guidelines</a>
	for other conventions.</p>
