    <h1>Getting started as a JCrypTool Developer</h1>

    <p>This page is intended for new JCrypTool developers who need to set up their development environment and their workspace for the first time.
    In order to get you started as soon and as easy as possible, please follow these instructions carefully.</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <p>In order to develop for the <strong>JCrypTool Core</strong> or <strong>Plug-ins</strong> project you need</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>A <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java SE Runtime Environment</a> (or Java SE Development Kit)
    	in version 1.6 or newer.</li>
    	<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> Indigo (3.7.x) in the Eclipse Classic or Eclipse for RCP/Plug-in Developers edition (other editions
    	are not suitable for plug-in development without additional extensions). The latest Eclipse version (maintenance release) is always recommended.</li>
    	<li>A Subversion plug-in: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/subversive">Subversive</a> (recommended) or <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation and first start</h2>

    <p>Install the Java Runtime, Eclipse and your desired Subversion plug-in. No other plug-ins are required for JCrypTool development.</p>

    <p>Start Eclipse afterwards and create a new (empty) workspace for JCrypTool. Open the <strong>Preferences</strong> and select
    the page <strong>Workspace</strong>  in the <strong>General</strong> section. Here you have to choose <strong>UTF-8</strong> as
    <strong>Text file encoding</strong> in the <strong>Other</strong> group.</p>

    <h3>Obtaining the JCrypTool sources</h3>

    <p>JCrypTool consists of two repositories: <b>JCrypTool Core</b> and <b>JCrypTool Plug-ins</b>. These two projects are located in different repositories.
    Both offer anonymous read access.</p>

	<p>In order to start your development, you need to check out the JCrypTool sources from the Subversion repositories. All JCrypTool Core projects are
	required. Those projects contain the JCrypTool platform as well as some basic plug-ins required by the JCrypTool platform. All JCrypTool Plug-ins
	projects are optional. Those projects contain the crypto plug-ins. We strongly recommend checking out both repositories and all contained projects.</p>

	<h4>Checking out the JCrypTool sources</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>JCrypTool Core <a href="https://jcryptool.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jcryptool">https://jcryptool.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jcryptool</a></li>
        <li>JCrypTool Plug-ins <a href="https://jctplugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jctplugins">https://jctplugins.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jctplugins</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>More information on Subversion access to our sources is available <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jcryptool/index.php?title=Subversion">here</a>.
    For more information on how to access our repositories visit</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=186495">JCrypTool Core</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=213279">JCrypTool Plug-ins</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The next step is to check out the actual projects from the repositories linked before. If you use Subversive as SVN plug-in, this is quite simple:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Select both repositories in the SVN Repositories view.</li>
		<li>Select <b>Find/Check Out As...</b> from the context menu.</li>
		<li>Finish the wizard on the first page, keeping all default settings (this will now take some time).</li>
		<li>A new dialog named Check Out Project shows up. Keep all defaults again and click Finish (this will again take some time).</li>
		<li>All plug-ins should appear as projects in your workspace.</li>
	</ol>

	<p><b>Important:</b> You must check out the trunk folder of every project! If you try to check out the projects directly, JCrypTool won't start!
	Do not close projects, all of them are required. A yellow exclamation mark in a feature project (these projects normally end with .feature) indicates
	normally that one or more (required) plug-ins are missing. In this case open the Feature Manifest Editor, switch to the Plug-ins tab and make sure that
	all listed plug-ins are available in your workspace. At this point ignore any warning in the feature projects org.jcryptool.core.dependencies.feature and
	org.jcryptool.core.dependencies.nl_de.feature.</p>

	<h3>Setting up a target platform</h3>

	<p>The steps to set up a target platform are described <a href="targetplatform.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h1>Starting JCrypTool in your Eclipse environment (IDE)</h1>

    <p>After checking out at least all JCrypTool Core projects into your workspace, open the file <b>jcryptool.product</b> located
    in the <b>org.jcryptool.core</b> project with the Product Configuration Editor. Simply click on the <b>Launch an Eclipse
    application</b> link in the lower left on the first page. This starts JCrypTool and creates a run menu entry. Later launches
    can be done directly via the run menu entry or via the Launch an Eclipse application link in the Product Configuration Editor.</p>

    <p>In case the first launch stops with an error message open the generated run menu entry (normally named <em>jcryptool.product</em>)
    and switch to the <strong>Plug-ins</strong> tab in the <strong>Run Configurations</strong> dialog. Click on the
    <strong>Add Required Plug-ins</strong> button and after that on the <strong>Run</strong> button. JCrypTool should be launched without
    any error message now.</p>

    <p>JCrypTool will be launched in the language defined in your operating systems regional settings. Follow the instructions
    provided <a href="../develop/plugins/internationalization.html">here</a> to switch the active language.</p>

    <p><b>Important:</b> From time to time, new plug-ins or features will be added to the default JCrypTool configuration. After
    checking out those projects and/ or updating the corresponding features, you must use the Launch an Eclipse application link
    again to update your run entry configuration (otherwise the projects will be available in your workspace but won't be available
    during JCrypTool runtime).</p>
