	<p>JCrypTool can be extended with own <a href="plugins/toc.html">Plug-ins</a> in almost any place. Use
	<a href="features/toc.html">Features</a> to group and organize plug-ins in order to make end users
	the installation of plug-ins as easy as possible.</p>

	<p>Plug-ins and features can be installed in different ways in JCrypTool. The most easy way is to use a
	<strong>p2 Update Site</strong>. In case you do not have any web space available you can offer a downloadable
	(zip-)archive. Users can extract this archive into the <strong>dropins</strong> folder of their JCrypTool
	installation directory.</p>
