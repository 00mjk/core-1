	<h1>Features</h1>

	<p>Features are used for grouping of plug-ins that do belong together. A feature therefore contains no code at all. Instead
	it contains only a list of plug-ins (in XML), which lists all plug-ins that belong to the feature, including all required
	dependencies. So features are mainly used to make installation and maintenance easier for the end user.</p>
