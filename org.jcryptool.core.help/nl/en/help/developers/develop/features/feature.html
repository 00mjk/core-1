	<h1>Features</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool recommends feature usage. However it is possible to only develop plug-ins and to install them separately in
	JCrypTool. JCrypTool itself is segmented in different features. All feature projects end on <strong>.feature</strong> and
	in case of crypto plug-ins do contain the name of the category as well. For example
	<strong>org.jcryptool.crypto.modern.feature</strong>.</p>

	<p>To use an Update Site for plug-in maintenance you have to use features, never plug-ins. Even in case only one plug-in
	changed in the whole feature set.</p>
