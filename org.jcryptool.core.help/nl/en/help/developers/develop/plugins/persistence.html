	<h1>Persisting User Data</h1>

	<p>Although it might look like JCrypTool does not have a workspace (there is no way for the user to specify a folder),
	JCrypTool does have one. The name of this folder is <b>.jcryptool</b> and it is located in the <b>user home directory</b>.
	The <b>.</b> at the beginning hides this folder per default. The normal user doesn't need to care about this folder, but
	this is the right place for you as a developer to persist user data.</p>

    <h2>Preferences</h2>

    <p>The easiest way to persist user data is to use the preferences. As everything else, JCrypTool preferences are Eclipse
    based. Stick to this and JCrypTool (Eclipse) takes care of persisting this user data in the <b>.jcryptool/.metadata</b>
    folder. The structure in this folder gets confusing, but luckily you do not have to care about that. Just use the methods
    offered by Eclipse for loading and storing preferences. Look around in JCrypTool; there are plenty of examples on how to
    do that!</p>

    <h3>Implementation sample for the preferences</h3>

    <p>GeneralPreferencePage.java in org.jcryptool.fileexplorer.preferences, plug-in org.jcryptool.fileexplorer</p>

    <h2>Files</h2>

    <p>Sometimes storing user data as preferences is not an option. You need a file. This is possible too, and there are no
    limitations on where you can store these files. But why not use the workspace folder .jcryptool for that too? One place
    for all our files. And this folder will always be there, the JCrypTool runtime takes care of that. So there is absolutely
    no need for you to do an exists() check for this folder or to even try to create it.</p>

    <p>Storing files in the installation directory (jcryptool, the one without the . at the beginning which contains all
    plug-ins) is not a good idea. This will cause trouble on multi user systems and it might even be write protected.</p>

    <h3>Discovering the Workspace</h3>

    <div class="code">
    // receiving the workspace<br />
    IWorkspace workspace = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace();<br />
    // receiving the workspace path<br />
    String path = workspace.getRoot().getLocation().toString();<br /><br />
    // the short way, combined in a single line<br />
    String path = ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().getLocation().toString();</div>

    <p><b>IWorkspace</b> and the <b>ResourcesPlugin</b> are contained in the <b>org.eclipse.core.resources</b> plug-in. Simply
    add this plug-in to your dependencies list and you are good to go. Use always the code shown above, do not hard code the
    path as the workspace folder might be located somewhere else in the future.</p>

    <p>The returned path will look like <b>/Users/username/.jcryptool</b> on a Mac or
    <b>C:\Documents and Settings\username\.jcryptool</b> on Windows. It is wise to create a folder inside the <b>.jcryptool</b>
    folder which is related to your plug-in or indicates the type of files you want to store in there. Examples are
    <b>.jcryptool/alphabets</b> for the classic <b>alphabet.xml</b> files or <b>.jcryptool/flexiprovider</b> for FlexiProvider
    related data. Again, the .jcryptool folder is created automatically the moment JCrypTool is being started. Even if the user
    deletes this folder it will be recreated the next time JCrypTool is being started. Any folder in .jcryptool on the other
    side is optional, except the .metadata folder. So verify that your folder(s) and your file(s) exist before using it. And
    do not misuse the .metadata folder for storing your files, .metadata is for preferences and logs only!</p>

    <h3>Implementation sample for storing files in the workspace folder</h3>

    <p>AlphabetStore.java in org.jcryptool.crypto.classic.alphabets.tools, plug-in org.jcryptool.crypto.classic.alphabets<br />
    OperationsManager.java in org.jcryptool.crypto.flexiprovider.operations, plug-in org.jcryptool.crypto.flexiprovider.operations<br />
    KeyStorePlugin.java in org.jcryptool.crypto.keystore, plug-in org.jcryptool.crypto.keystore</p>
