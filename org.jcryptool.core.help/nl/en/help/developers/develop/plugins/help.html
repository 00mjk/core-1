	<h1>Help Contents</h1>

	<p>The JCrypTool help is based on a fixed structure which makes it easy for end users and developers to navigate and to find
	certain help content. This requires all JCrypTool plug-ins to follow this structure and to extend the help contents only at
	the defined points.</p>

	<p><strong>No plug-in is allowed to extend the help content on the top level, meaning there is no other entry allowed on the
	level of the four books.</strong></p>

	<p>The complete help is available in two languages (German and English). Plug-in developers are encouraged to provide both
	languages as well and to use the default Eclipse mechanisms to achieve that goal (by using the <strong>nl</strong>
	directories). Remember to add those directories to the build.properties file; otherwise they will be missing in the
	binary build.</p>
    
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    
    <p>Each help must be made available in the HTML format. Avoid using your own css stylings. Each page must have a header using
    the h1 tag. Text contained in this h1 element must be repeated in the title element inside the page head.</p>
    
    <h2>Spelling</h2>

    <p>Eclipse offers a basic spell check only. Please use your text application too in order to avoid nasty typos.</p>

	<h2>Categories</h2>

	<p>Help consists of four categories: <a href="#userguide">User Guide</a>, <a href="#developerguide">Developer Guide</a>,
	<a href="#cryptology">Cryptology</a> and <a href="#glossary">Glossary</a>. Every category can be extended. Crypto plug-ins
	usually extended the category <strong>User Guide</strong>. The <strong>Developer Guide</strong> is normally not extended,
	however it is possible.</p>

	<p>Use the <strong>link_to</strong> attribute to integrate a help page into a certain topic, e.g.
	<em>link_to=&quot;../org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/toc_users_guide.xml#visualizations&quot;</em> to integrate a help page
	into the visualizations category. A complete <strong>toc.xml</strong> for a classic algorithm plug-in for example looks
	like this:</p>

	<div class="code">
	&lt;toc label=&quot;Caesar&quot; link_to=&quot;../org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/toc_users_guide.xml#classicAlgorithmPlugins&quot;&gt;<br/>
	&nbsp;&lt;topic label=&quot;Caesar Encryption&quot; href=&quot;$nl$/help/content/tutorial.html&quot; /&gt;<br/>
	&lt;/toc&gt;
	</div>

	<h3><a name="userguide"></a>User Guide</h3>

	<p>The user guide should make the first steps of new users as easy as possible. Every plug-in, normal and crypto plug-ins,
	should at least provide one page with informations on how to use it. In depth cryptographic information should be contained
	in the category <strong>Cryptology</strong> (provide links between the two parts). This category answers the questions, what
	a user can do with a plug-in and how he can do it. Explanations and theories for the cryptographic mechanisms belong into the
	<strong>Cryptology</strong> category.</p>

	<h3><a name="developerguide"></a>Developer Guide</h3>

	<p>The developer guide should explain the JCrypTool conventions and requirements to all interested developers. This category
	explains how to extend JCrypTool with plug-ins. Normally this category is maintained by the JCrypTool Core Team. In case a
	plug-in is offering own extension points it is possible to extend this part of the online help as well.</p>
