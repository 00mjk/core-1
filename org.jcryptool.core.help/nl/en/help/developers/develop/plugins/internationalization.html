	<h1>Internationalization</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool is available in two languages: <strong>English</strong> (the primary language) and
	<strong>German</strong>. Therefore you should internationalize your plug-in, even if you plan to
	only support one language (in this case this must be English, but offering a German translation is
	strongly recommended). Eclipse offers great support here, so a lot is done automatically.</p>

	<p>You have to make sure the following things:</p>

	<ol>
	    <li>All <strong>plugin.xml</strong> strings are externalized to <strong>bundle.properties</strong>
	    (English, default) and <strong>bundle_de.properties</strong>. Right click on <strong>plugin.xml</strong>
	    and choose <strong>PDE Tools --&gt; Externalize Strings</strong>. Follow the dialogs. This creates the
	    English version. Just copy the <strong>bundle.properties</strong> file and rename it for the German
	    version to <strong>bundle_de.properties</strong> (and of course translate its content). Make sure that
	    both files are added to <strong>build.properties</strong>, otherwise they won't be shipped (only the
	    automatically generated file bundle.properties is added by Eclipse, the German translation in the
	    bundle_de.properties file therefore is missing in the binary build).</li>
	    <li><strong>Externalize strings</strong> (like messages and titles) from all your classes. Select the
	    <strong>src</strong> folder of your plug-in and choose <strong>Source --&gt; Externalize Strings</strong>
	    in the menu. Follow the dialogs. Important: use the <strong>Eclipse mechanism</strong> (select the
	    checkbox). Eclipse offers some ugly keys as default; you are encouraged to change that to more human
	    readable ones. Anyhow, the wizard creates a <strong>messages.properties</strong> file for every package,
	    which contains (as before) the English text strings. Copy this file and rename it to
	    <strong>messages_de.properties</strong> for a German version. Translate the content. The
	    <strong>Messages</strong> class takes care of the mapping between properties and classes.</li>
	    <li>The <strong>nl</strong> directory contains two languages <strong>de</strong> and <strong>en</strong>,
	    and each directory contains the same files (this is important!). <strong>toc.xml</strong> is the help
	    index file, <strong>contexts.xml</strong> (optional) the context sensitive help. toc.xml is referenced
	    in plugin.xml via <strong>$nl$/toc.xml</strong>. context.xml is referenced via
	    <strong>$nl$/contexts.xml</strong>. This is resolved automatically by Eclipse. Those two files should be
	    located in the root directory of every language (in the en or de directory). Add subdirectories for the
	    html files and graphics that make up your help.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>See <strong>org.jcryptool.crypto.classic.vigenere</strong> for a complete example. It is important to use
	this mechanism and to use the default file names that Eclipse offers. This is the Eclipse default, and Eclipse
	takes care of the mapping for each language during runtime. And using the same file names in each plug-in makes
	it easy for developers to follow along across different plug-ins.</p>

	<p>The following table shows some common characters and their Unicode representation.</p>

	<table>
	  <thead>
	    <tr>
	      <th style="width:50%">Character</th>
	      <th style="width:50%">Unicode</th>
	    </tr>
	  </thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>ä</td>
				<td>\u00e4</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Ä</td>
				<td>\u00c4</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ö</td>
				<td>\u00f6</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Ö</td>
				<td>\u00d6</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ü</td>
				<td>\u00fc</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Ü</td>
				<td>\u00dc</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ß</td>
				<td>\u00df</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<h2>Testing</h2>

	<p>Please test all available language versions of your plug-in. It is relatively easy to forget a translated
	file or an html page in one language, which is an annoying bug...</p>

	<p>Testing different languages is easy:</p>

	<ol>
	    <li>open your <strong>Run Configurations</strong> dialog and select the JCrypTool entry</li>
	    <li>switch to the <strong>Arguments tab</strong></li>
	    <li>in the <strong>Program Arguments</strong> text field replace the <strong>-nl</strong> value (the text in
	    <strong>{}</strong>) with <strong>en</strong> (so you end up with <strong>-nl en</strong> for example)</li>
	    <li>name this run entry e.g. JCrypTool English press the Apply button</li>
	    <li>copy (duplicate) your run menu entry and rename the run menu entry to JCrypTool German</li>
	    <li>on the <strong>Arguments</strong> tab, replace the <strong>en</strong> with <strong>de</strong> (so you
	    end up with <strong>-nl de</strong>)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>It is wise to clear the workspace at each start, which can be done automatically by selecting the
	<strong>clear</strong> checkbox on the first tab in the run dialog. Otherwise you may end up with a mixture
	of German and English.</p>

	<h2>Restriction</h2>

	<p>Following the above procedure does not translate the default Eclipse dialogs (like preferences). These dialogs
	must be provided in an internationalized version via the JCrypTool Core. A plug-in developer cannot provide
	translations for these generic parts.</p>
