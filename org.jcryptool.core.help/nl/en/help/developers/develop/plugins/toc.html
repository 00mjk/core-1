	<h1>Plug-ins</h1>

	<p>Plug-ins are the common way to extend JCrypTool. Based on the type of plug-in
	<a href="menus.html">menus and toolbars</a>,  <a href="help.html">help contents</a>,
	<a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> or other parts of the
	<a href="plugin.html">GUI</a> will be extended with new functionality.</p>

	<p>No matter what you plan to extend, please have a look at the hints on
	<a href="internationalization.html">internationalization</a> and <a href="persistence.html">persistence</a>.</p>

    <h2>First Steps</h2>

    <p>JCrypTool contains and offers the same extension points as Eclipse (e.g. for views). However, it is not enough to extend
    these extension points to add a new crypto plug-in to JCrypTool. To add e.g. a new visualization to the
    <a href="../../../users/general/view_algorithms.html">Crypto Explorer</a> (and at the same time to the
    <a href="menus.html">menu</a>), the special JCrypTool
    <a href="../extensionpoints.html">Extension Point</a> <em>org.jcryptool.core.operations.visuals</em> must be extended as well
    (or the corresponding extension points for analysis and other cryptographic operations).</p>

    <p>After that, the runtime configuration (the entry in the run menu) must be extended. The new plug-in has to be added on
    the <em>Plug-ins</em> tab. For exporting, the corresponding <a href="../features/toc.html">Feature</a> must be updated by
    adding the plug-in there as well.</p>
