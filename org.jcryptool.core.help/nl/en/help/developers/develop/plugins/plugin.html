	<h1>Plug-ins</h1>

	<p>Plug-ins are the smallest executable components to extend JCrypTool (well, actually fragments are even smaller,
	but cannot be executed alone). In order to deliver a plug-in via an <strong>Update Site</strong> you have to integrate
	it into a <a href="../features/toc.html">Feature</a>.</p>

	<p>JCrypTool consists of many plug-ins. All core plug-ins are part of the platform itself. Those plug-ins offer for
	example <a href="../../../users/general/editors.html">editors</a> or supporting views like the
	<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.fileexplorer/$nl$/help/view.html">File Explorer</a> or the
	<a href="../../../users/general/view_algorithms.html">Crypto Explorer</a> view.</p>

	<p>The bulk of plug-ins are crypto plug-ins, from analysis to visualizations. Almost any of those plug-ins is highly
	specialized and offers for example the implementation of a certain cryptographic operation.</p>

	<p>There are no fixed requirements on how which type of crypto plug-in extends which part of the GUI. Most algorithm plug-ins
	do use wizards, whereas the rest (analysis, games, visualizations) is available as views. However this decision is up to the
	developer. No matter which parts will be extended it is essential to stick to the Eclipse recommendations and conventions. This
	means that there are absolutely no explanations in the wizards' content area. Such explanations belong into the wizards head,
	longer ones into the context help. Views only contain such explanations in the context help, nowhere else.</p>

	<p>We recommend signing all your plug-ins, after all, JCrypTool is an e-learning platform for cryptography!</p>

	<h2>Components</h2>

	<p>Besides the actual cryptographic implementation a complete JCrypTool plug-in consists of an online help with
	detailed information on how to use the plug-in, the cryptographic background of the implementation and context
	sensitive help. Interactive <strong>Cheat Sheets</strong> are optional. Every text should be available in German
	and English. English is a must have, German is optional but strongly recommended. The plug-in should be fully
	<a href="internationalization.html">internationalized</a> and contain German and English translations.</p>

	<p>Make sure that at the end of development, all files are included in the binary build. Check the <strong>build.properties</strong>
	file for that matter and verify that all required files are selected.</p>

	<h2>Operating System Independence</h2>

	<p>JCrypTool supports the systems Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. Normally the differences between those systems do not affect the plug-in
	developer. However, some points, depending on the plug-in, do matter. Resources, like icons or html files of a plug-in, may not contain
	any spaces in their filename. Use lowercase letters everywhere.<br/>
	File system access in a file dialog must define a start directory that is available on every system. The JCrypTool default is to use
	<strong>System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;)</strong> which starts in the user home directory.</p>

	<h2>Cryptographic Operations</h2>

	<p>Depending on the file size or editor content and the chosen algorithm (key strength, parameters, ...) cryptographic operations may
	take a while. In case those actions are executed in the UI-Thread the whole JCrypTool will be blocked. And the operation feels much
	longer than it actually is. Normal Eclipse Actions or Commands are executed in the UI-Thread by default. We recommend using a Job and
	to swap the operation in a separate task. This way the GUI doesn't block, the user is informed about the progress and can continue to
	use JCrypTool normally.</p>

	<div class="code">
		Job job = new Job("Jobtitle") {<br/>
        &nbsp;public IStatus run(final IProgressMonitor monitor) {<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;try {<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// with fixed length and monitor.worked(step); calls<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monitor.beginTask("Jobtitle", 5);<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// OR with unknown length<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monitor.beginTask("Jobtitle", IProgressMonitor.UNKNOWN);<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (monitor.isCanceled()) {<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return Status.CANCEL_STATUS;<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;} catch (final Exception ex) {<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LogUtil.logError(ex);<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;} finally {<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monitor.done();<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;return Status.OK_STATUS;<br/>
        &nbsp;}<br/>
        };<br/>
        job.setUser(true);<br/>
        job.schedule();
	</div>

	<h2>File Explorer</h2>

	<p>The <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.fileexplorer/$nl$/help/view.html">File Explorer</a> enables cryptographic operations on files without actually opening them. This
	way even large files can be encrypted. However the default setting is to open all files prior to the cryptographic
	operation and afterwards the result. In case of huge files this can result into a significant waiting period until
	the editor is opened. Because of that users can set some preferences to not open the input file before the cryptographic
	operation and to not open the resulting file (e.g. the cipher text file) automatically. Plug-in developers can query
	those settings using the IDs <strong>fileExplorerOpenSource</strong> and <strong>fileExplorerOpenTarget</strong>.
	Return value is of type Boolean in each case. We recommend that all crypto plug-ins have a look at those parameters
	before executing any file operation.</p>
