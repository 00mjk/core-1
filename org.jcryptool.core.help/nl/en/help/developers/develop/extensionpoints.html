	<h1>Extension Points</h1>

	<p>JCrypTool contains a growing number of <strong>Extension Points</strong>. Extension points are the best way to extend
	JCrypTool. Most of the extension points (the most important ones too) are contained in the
	<strong>org.jcryptool.core.operations</strong> plug-in: from algorithms to providers, all cryptographic extension points
	are available in this plug-in.</p>

	<p>Extension points are always defined in an <strong>*.exsd</strong> file. This file is normally located in a
	<strong>schema</strong> subfolder of the defining plug-in. Any JCrypTool extension point can be used as a normal Eclipse
	extension point: open the plugin.xml of your plug-in and click on the Add button on the extensions page of the editor. All
	JCrypTool extension points start with <strong>org.jcryptool</strong> as ID, e.g. org.jcryptool.core.algorithms.</p>

	<h2>Extension Point documentation</h2>

	<p>Add the extension point as described above to your plug-in. After selecting the new entry a link
	<strong>Show extension point description</strong> appears on the right side of the editor. Simply follow this link for
	information on the selected extension point. You can use the other links provided to find the extension point schema
	or to jump to the declaring plug-in.</p>

	<h2>Important Extension Points</h2>

	<p>The most used extension points in JCrypTool are the ones required for cryptographic extensions (crypto plug-ins):</p>

	<ul>
		<li>org.jcryptool.core.operations.algorithms</li>
		<li>org.jcryptool.core.operations.analysis</li>
		<li>org.jcryptool.core.operations.games</li>
		<li>org.jcryptool.core.operations.visuals</li>
	</ul>

	<p>One of these extension points is required to extend JCrypTool with a new crypto plug-in. This extension point takes
	care of adding the cryptographic extension (e.g. an algorithm) to the corresponding menu and to the
	<a href="../../users/general/view_algorithms.html">Crypto Explorer</a> view. This means you do not have to provide any more
	information than the fields highlighted with a <strong>*</strong> to make your new extension available in JCrypTool.</p>
