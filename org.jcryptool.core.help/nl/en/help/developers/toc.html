	<h1>Developer Guide</h1>

	<p>The <strong>Developer Guide</strong> contains information for developers and advanced users, who wish to extend
	JCrypTool with their own plug-ins.</p>

	<p>This part of the JCrypTool online help is not an introduction into the development of Eclipse plug-ins. Instead we
	are talking about the requirements and characteristics of JCrypTool plug-in development. Please consult one of the
	many books and <a href="resources.html">web sites</a> available for plug-in and RCP development basics. You should have
	at least some knowledge about Eclipse development before you start developing a plug-in for JCrypTool.</p>

	<p>Even with this constraint it is more or less impossible to describe all aspects of JCrypTool plug-in development. Since
	all sources are available for free we do recommend that you have a look at them before and during your development phase.
	Stick to the samples that best fit your to your category (e.g. classical algorithms or analysis) so that you don't get lost
	in the many JCrypTool plug-ins.</p>

	<p>The latest information on JCrypTool development is available in our English <a href="https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki">wiki</a>.
	Feel free to join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/jcryptool-developers">JCrypTool Developers Group</a>.</p>
