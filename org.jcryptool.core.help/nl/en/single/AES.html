AES (CBC) (Menu Encrypt/Decrypt \ Symmetric (modern))

The AES (CBC) encryption algorithm (also known as Rijndael) works with a variable block length e.g. 128 bits, and a variable key length e.g. 128, 192 and 256 bits.

CrypTool uses Rijndael in CBC mode with zero initialization vector and 01-00 padding.

The key is entered in the Key entry dialog.

CrypTool contains a brute-force attack on the Rijndael encryption algorithm.

The Rijndael Algorithm has been proposed for FIPS standardisation. Therefore it will be the successor of the antiquated Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm (see AES winner).

Remark:

The funny cartoon "A Stick Figure Guide to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)" by Jeff Moser, published in September 2009, explains the AES algorithm in 4 acts:

The AES Winner Rijndael

NIST (U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology) set up an international competition with the goal to create a new symmetric encryption algorithm that should be come a new standard in the USA. The competition ended on 2 October 2000 when Norman Y. Mineta declared Rijndael as the new national standard.

So Rijndael is the winner of the three year competition where a number of the most well known cryptographers were involved. Mineta said "finally this standard will serve as a tool for security critical IT-applications and will be a vehicle for a quick growth of eCommerce. Rijndael will enable eCommerce and eGovernment and will create new opportunities for all Americans."

NIST organized and supervised the competition which was strongly influenced by the private sector. NIST asked for suggestions for new algorithms since 12 September 1997. A considerable number of organizations from every region of the world answered this call. As a requirement NIST postulated that the algorithm supports the key lengths 128, 192 and 256. For a 128 bit key there are approximately 340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000=34*10^37 possible keys.

Rijndael was developed by the Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen from Proton-Welt International and Vincent Rijmen, member of the Catholic University Leuven. Both of them are known as very experienced members of the crypto community.

After the final acceptance AES will be a publicly available patent free standard used to protect long-term data. It will substitute the DES-Algorithm (Data Encryption Standard) which was introduced in 1977.

Until recently cryptography was mainly used for governmental and military purposes. Nowadays millions of people use cryptography without even noticing. It is used for internet-shopping or with automatic teller machines (ATM).

DES and a variant (Triple-DES) is today widely used, even in the private sector. The new AES-Algorithm will be implicitly used by millions of consumers and virtually all companies and service providers.

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) became a US Federal standard on November 26, 2001 according to the document FIPS Publication 197.

On December 4, 2001 this was announced in a Federal Register Notice and in a press release.

AES was developed to replace the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in a multi-year effort that began in 1997. The AES specifies a cryptographic algorithm that can be used to protect electronic data by encrypting (enciphering) and decrypting (deciphering) information.

AES candidates

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the US Department of Commerce began an initiative in 1997 under the name of "Advanced Encryption Standard" (AES) that was aimed at standardising a new algorithm which should replace the DES algorithm in future in all applications and on all platforms.

In a public and transparent process, one algorithm is to be selected as successor to the DES out of all the suggestions publicly submitted.

At the second AES Conference on 22/23 March 1999 in Rome, the algorithms which at the time were up for discussion and the analyses performed with them were presented and discussed. The conference was attended by approx. 180 persons from 23 countries, and 21 papers were presented.

In the first round there were 15 proposals, from which the final AES algorithm is to be selected over several stages. Further information on this is available from http://www.nist.gov/aes.

In the second round five proposals were left in the running, MARS, RC6, Rijndael, Serpent and Twofish.

Requirements which a new algorithm must satisfy:

In an appeal issued by NIST on 12 September 1997 the following requirements which a successor to the DES must satisfy were defined.

Symmetric block cipher

    Must support as a minimum key lengths of 128,192 and 256 bits and a block length of 128 bits.
    Must be better than current algorithms: securer and more efficient (as regards runtime, space required on chip) than Triple-DES.
    Must be capable of being used in different application environments.
    Must be usable for Stream Cipher, Message Authentication Code (MAC) generator, pseudorandom number generator, hash function etc.
    Must be implementable on hardware and software.
    Must be available in the public domain all over the world.
    Security should be guaranteed for 20-30 years.
    The algorithm should be defined and evaluated publicly.

On 2 October 2000 the winner of the AES competition was announced, and the Belgian Rijndael algorithm has been proposed for FIPS standardisation, thus being the designated successor to the now somewhat elderly Data Encryption Standard.
