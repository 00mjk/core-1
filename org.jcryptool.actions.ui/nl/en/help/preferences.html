    <h1>Actions Preferences</h1>

    <p>In the <a href="view.html">Actions</a> preferences it is possible to set different options for the view itself and the data to store
    in a cascade.</p>

    <h2>Layout</h2>

    <p>By default, the name of the cryptographically changed file is shown in the Actions view. This name is only useful for your orientation/
    information during recording and has no impact during replay. In case you are irritated by this name you can select to hide it by deselecting
    the checkbox.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>

    <p>You can select to store passwords in plaintext here. During recording these passwords are stored in your computers' memory. When exporting
    the cascade all this information will be written in plaintext into the XML file. In case you are exchanging cascades with other users they
    will find out your passwords. With classic algorithms this is not as critical as with modern algorithms.</p>

    <p>However this is not a security issue, but it might be a problem in case you are reusing your passwords or are using your productive keys
    inside JCrypTool. As a rule of thumb always create new keystores and keys for JCrypTool, never reuse any important key. Exchanging keystores
    and keys with other users makes it much easier to replay any cascade in another environment. Without exchanging the passwords the user will be
    prompted for the keystore and the key password during executing the cascade.</p>

    <h2>Exception Handling</h2>

    <p>During the execution of an action cascade it might be possible, that some problems occur, e.g. if a algorithm plug-in that
    should be used is not available in the installation. With these settings you can define how the cascade should behave in case of such errors.</p>

    <p>If the preference <strong>Skip error on action and continue cascade</strong> is set, the execution of the cascade is continued after an exception has
    occurred. Otherwise the execution is stopped. With the preference <strong>Don't display error messages</strong> you can manage whether the error should be shown
    in a dialog. In all cases the occurring errors are written to the ErrorLog.</p>
