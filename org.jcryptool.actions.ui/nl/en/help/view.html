    <h1>Actions</h1>

    <p><strong>Actions</strong> enables you to record and replay cryptographic operations. Like a <em>macro recorder</em>, every executed
   	cryptographic operation is recorded. All information is automatically added to a protocol which can be accessed via the Actions view.
   	This view can start the replay of all cryptographic operations in the order recorded before. Normally no additional action is required
   	by you, the cascade is replayed fully automatically. With the export and import functionality, cascades can be shared with other users
   	and cascades of other users can be replayed. You can study Actions by looking at the provided <a href="#examples">examples</a>.</p>

   	<p>Keep in mind that the cascade is not saved automatically! After restarting JCrypTool the old cascade will not be available any more. In case
   	you want to persist your cascade use the <a href="#export">Export</a> functionality to save it into an XML file.</p>

    <div class="screenshot">
		<img src="images/view_actions.png" width="235" height="292" alt="Actions"/>
	</div>

	<p>The active editor is always the starting point when replaying a cascade. The editors content will be changed cryptographically by the
	action cascades items. In order to generate identical output with a cascade you need to provide identical input. However, this is not strictly
	required, a cascade can be applied to any editor content.</p>

	<p>Click on any item in the view for additional information in the details area. Details shown here are for example the used alphabet, key
	length and various other parameters. The shown parameters depend on the selected entry type (e.g. classic and modern algorithms do have
	different parameters).</p>

	<p>It doesn't matter how you call the algorithm wizards. All operations started via the Crypto Explorer view or via the Algorithms menu will be
	recorded.</p>

    <h2>Terms</h2>

    <h3>Item</h3>

    <p>An item corresponds to one entry in the Actions view, e.g. an AES encryption. Every item therefore stands for a cryptographic operation.
    An XOR decryption in the sample shown above would be another item.</p>

    <h3>Cascade</h3>

    <p>A cascade contains at least one entry (there is no upper limit). The order is important: During replay the items will be executed in the
    given order and will be applied to the corresponding editor content. A cascade contains a name in the form <strong>[Filename]Cascade.xml</strong>.
    The filename will be the name of the initial editor used. The cascades' name is only important when using import or export functionality.</p>

    <p>The screenshot shown above contains a cascade with two entries (cryptographic operations): a Caesar encryption and a XOR encryption.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>All actions will be executed via the toolbar or the identical menu of the view. Depending on the situation some entries may be deactivated.</p>

    <div class="screenshot">
			<img src="images/view_menu.png" width="180" height="23" alt="Actions Toolbar and Menu"/>
		</div>

    <p>An entry can be deleted or moved up/ down via the context menu in the view (right click on one entry).</p>

    <h3>New</h3>

    <p>Clicking on <strong>New</strong> creates a new cascade. You have to confirm this action in case the view does already contain entries (those
    entries will be lost!).</p>

    <h3>Record</h3>

    <p>A click on the <strong>Record</strong> icon starts recording a cascade. In case the cascade already contains entries the new ones will be appended
    to it. To stop (pause) or to continue the recording you'll have to click on the icon again. You can stop and continue the recording at any point.
    During a paused recording it is possible to execute (or try) cryptographic operations which will not be included in the recording.</p>

    <p>The editor content is not contained in the recorded information. The file name shown in the Actions view therefore is for your convenience only.
    Recorded are the action type (like encryption, signature, hash) and the used algorithm. The details for a classic algorithm for example contain information
    on the used alphabet and the key. Modern algorithms do contain the corresponding key information.</p>

    <p>It is important to know that during a recording session all cryptographic actions applied to any opened editor are recorded.</p>

    <h3>Play</h3>

    <p>You can execute your own or any imported cascade. Simply open the file you want to manipulate with the cascade in one of the JCrypTool
	<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/general/editors.html">editors</a> and click on <strong>Play</strong>. The cascade
	will be executed from start to end and all cryptographic operations will be applied to the active editor. Like during a normal (manual) cryptographic
	operation a new editor will be opened with the result of the cryptographic operation. This editor content will be used as input for the next step.</p>

	<p>The sample above would open two editor windows: the first editor contains the Caesar encrypted content of the selected source (the active editor). The
	second editor would contain the XOR encryption of the first result (the Caesar encryption). So the result of the previous operation creates the input
	for the following cryptographic operation. Applying a cascade on the same editor content therefore would create the same output.</p>

    <p>Normally you do not have to enter any additional information during executing a cascade. Simply lie back and let JCrypTool do all the work. Primarily with
    imported cascades some <a href="#possibleProblems">Problems</a> may occur. For that matter have a look at the <a href="#hints">Hints</a> too.</p>

    <h3>Remove</h3>

    <p>Single entries can be removed from every cascade. Simply select the desired entry an call the <strong>Remove</strong> command via the menu or the context
    menu.</p>

    <h3>Import</h3>

    <p>With <strong>Import</strong> it is possible to import foreign cascades and to execute them in your JCrypTool. You can even add (record) other entries to
    this cascade and you can edit them as you like.</p>

    <h3><a name="export"></a>Export</h3>

    <p>Use <strong>Export</strong> to export the active cascade from your Actions view. The cascade will be stored in an XML file and can be exchanged with other
    users. The filename complies with the selected file that started this cascade and the file extension XML. You can change the filename to any name you like.<br/>
    In principle and with enough XML knowledge you can edit this XML file in any (XML) editor. For security reasons, JCrypTool validates any XML file during import,
    and rejects any invalid file.</p>

    <h2>Extension of the File Explorer view</h2>

	<p>Actions extends the context menu of the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.fileexplorer/$nl$/help/view.html">File Explorer</a> view with the entry
	<strong>Import Action Cascade</strong>. This menu entry is active if an XML file is selected in the File Explorer view. Clicking on the menu item opens
	the selected <strong>Action Cascade</strong> in the <strong>Action view</strong> where it can be executed like any other action cascade.</p>

	<p>If you have selected a normal XML file and not a valid XML cascade, an error message will be presented and the file won't be opened in the
	Actions view.</p>

    <h2><a name="possibleProblems"></a>Possible Problems</h2>

    <p>There shouldn't be any problems when executing your own cascade. However when executing a cascade of another user it may be possible, that not all items
    can be executed. This can have different reasons. One reason might be JCrypTools' modularity. Other users can have a different installation, with different
    plug-ins that are not available in your installation. The cryptographic operation cannot be executed in this case. Furthermore it might be possible that
    not all cryptographic algorithms are available on every system in the desired length. Finally in case of modern operations it might be possible that the key
    or the keystore is missing.</p>

    <p>These problems can be avoided if you are using identical JCrypTool installations (and versions) and if all systems do contain the same keystores and keys.
    In case this doesn't help either try to reduce the key length.</p>

    <p>In order to integrate a crypto plug-in into the Action view some points have to be kept in mind during
    <a href="dev.html">development</a>. So even a crypto plug-in may be integrated into JCrypTool it is not guaranteed that this
    plug-in integrates as well into the Actions view.</p>

    <h2><a name="hints"></a>Additional Hints</h2>

    <p>In case you have activated the checkbox in the <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a> all passwords and other data of a cryptographic operation will be
    stored as plaintext. When exchanging a cascade with another user this user will see all included passwords and every other sensitive data. Since JCrypTool is
    an eLearning tool this is not a security problem. Instead this makes exchanging cascade much easier. In case you do not want to store passwords in the cascade
    simply deactivate the option in the <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a>. This requires that you or the user re-enter the password during replay.</p>
