      <description>After selecting an algorithm in the &lt;b&gt;Algorithms&lt;/b&gt; view, the corresponding entry will appear in the &lt;b&gt;Operations&lt;/b&gt; view. The Operations view allows you to enter the input source (either the text editor or a file) and the output destination (a file). Via drag and drop from the keystore a key can be added to a specific operation. It is necessary to add a matching key before executing an algorithm.

To execute an algorithm, after all parameters are set correctly, click on the execute icon in the upper right corner of the Operations view.</description>
