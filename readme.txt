The JCrypTool Core project contains all plug-ins required to run JCrypTool: the bare runtime, editors, crypto providers and some basic views. Core features, dependencies as well as the build projects are included in this repository too.

Have a look at our wiki at https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki for more information on how to get you started as a JCrypTool developer. Feel free to ask any question you might have in our developers group at http://groups.google.com/group/jcryptool-developers.
