		<description>This quick introduction explains how to use the Algorithm Perspective correctly. We use the RC6 block cipher as an example, as in the slideshow. The procedure for other algorithms is the same, so this guide can be used for other algorithms as well.

&lt;b&gt;1. Select Algorithm:&lt;/b&gt; Select an algorithm in the Algorithm Explorer. To do this, double-click on an entry. A dialog box appears in which you can make algorithm-specific settings. In this example we leave the default values and click on &quot;Finish&quot;. The selected entry now appears in the lower area of the JCT, in the operations view. To see input and output, keys and operations you have to open the entry by double clicking on it.

&lt;b&gt;2. Define Input and Output:&lt;/b&gt; You can define either the editor content or a file as input. The same applies to the output. To do this, open the &quot;Input/Output&quot; entry.  There you can now select an editor or file separately for input and output. Simply double-click the entry. A pop-up opens, allowing you to switch between &quot;Select file...&quot; and &quot;Use editor&quot;. If you select &quot;Select file...&quot;, a dialog opens in which you can select a file.

&lt;b&gt;3. Select Key:&lt;/b&gt; Now we need to select a matching key from the Keystore in the upper left-hand corner of JCT. To see the already existing keys, open one of the existing contacts, e.g. &quot;Alice Whitehead&quot;. There you will now see three categories of keys: key pairs (asymmetric), secret keys (symmetric) and certificates. Depending on the algorithm chosen in step 1, we will now open one of the categories. In our example we have chosen the block cipher RC6, which requires a secret key. We open this category. Since there is no RC6 suitable key, we must create a new RC6 key. We can do this using the golden key in the upper part of the Keystore. A dialog opens where we create a key for the selected algorithm and click &quot;Finish&quot;. The dialog closes and the new key appears in the category &quot;Secret keys&quot;. Now drag&apos;n&apos;drop this new key into the lower part of the JCT, the operations view. The key is now used for this algorithm.

&lt;b&gt;4. Determine Operation:&lt;/b&gt; Now we determine whether the input is encrypted, decrypted or hashed. To do this, we double-click on the &quot;Operation&quot; entry. A pop-up will open, in which we select one of the three operations. Depending on the selected algorithm, not all three operations are available for selection.

&lt;b&gt;5. Execute Operation:&lt;/b&gt; To execute the operation with the selected algorithm, key, input and output we click on the green triangle in the upper right corner of the operations view. The operation is now executed. If you have selected &quot;Use editor&quot; as output, a new editor window opens with the output. If you have selected &quot;Select file...&quot; your file now contains the output.</description>
