	<h1>File Explorer Preferences</h1>

	<p>The File Explorer preferences offer you to select your home directory. This directory is shown expanded in the
	view. Additionally, you can jump immediately to this directory by clicking on the <em>Home</em> icon.</p>

	<p>The next two options are extremely usable when dealing with huge files. Normally, JCrypTool opens the original
	file before a cryptographic operation in one of the editors. After the operation, the resulting file is shown
	in an editor too. In case of huge files or slow computers, this may require a lot of time. In this case you can
	select to not open the original and/ or the resulting file automatically. These settings only take affect when
	executing the cryptographic operation via the context menu of the File Explorer.</p>
