JCrypTool Core
=======

The **JCrypTool Core** repository contains all plug-ins required to run JCrypTool: the bare runtime, editors, crypto providers and some basic views. Core features, dependencies as well as the build projects are included in this repository too.

This core platform is extended by the crypto plug-ins available in the [JCrypTool Crypto](https://github.com/jcryptool/crypto) repository.

Have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki) for more information, especially the [Getting started as a JCrypTool Developer](https://github.com/jcryptool/core/wiki/Getting-started-as-a-JCrypTool-Developer) page. Feel free to ask any question you might have in our [developers group](http://groups.google.com/group/jcryptool-developers).

JCrypTool downloads are available as [weekly builds](http://www.cryptool.org/en/jct-downloads-en/jct-downloads-weekly-en) (unstable) and as [release builds](http://www.cryptool.org/en/jct-downloads-en/jct-downloads-stable-en) (stable).

General information on the CrypTool and JCrypTool projects is available in the [CrypTool](http://www.cryptool.org) portal.
